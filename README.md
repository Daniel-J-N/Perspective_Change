# Perspective_Change Development
This program is for practicing multiplication tables. 
It generates 5 random multiplication questions for the user to answer. 
After completing the quiz, the program provides feedback on the user's performance, marks, and time taken.
This was my most challenging assignment given first year. I made the program using python and broke it down into parts as I coded it. I broke it down into the following: 
- Function to generate a random multiplication question.
- Function to validate the user's input and handle incorrect input.
- Function to calculate the user's score based on the answers provided.
- Function to display the user's score and time taken after each session.
- Function to handle the user's choice of doing another session.
